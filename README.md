# Intro
The script above is to create a person detector on the Viam platform, as a project to become familiar with Viam. 

https://docs.viam.com/tutorials/projects/send-security-photo/ was used as reference for the work here.

The script provides an example for how a client/application can be built with sensors/hardware connected to the Viam server.
